# Zoe

How many times have you had to wait for hours in Hospital queues just to get a tablet for Cold or Fever? 
This project was developed exactly to combat that issue. Long waiting queues have become a pressing issue in today's healthcare scenario. Our voice-bot Zoe is a healthcare assistant that can speed up doctor consultations by diagnosing those with less severe symptoms while booking appointments for those suffering from more dangerous symptoms. 
This project was built using:
## Tensorflow, Tkinter, SpeechRecognition, pyttsx3
While currently, this project is currently in the development stage, better data would certainly help train the bot to be more accurate. I continue to improve this project as I gain more knowledge.
